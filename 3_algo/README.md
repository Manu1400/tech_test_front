# Algorithmic : Data structures manipulation

## Introduction

The file **./data.json** define a tree structure. The goal is to output a Tree using simple React Component (mostly using ```<ul>``` and ```<li>``` html tags)


## Goals

Create a function that outputs the Tree using basic HTML list tags corresponding to the input data specified in **./data.json**

The resulting output must be the following :
- Library 1
    - Skill 1
        - Skill 11
        - Skill 12
        - Skill 13
            - Skill 131
                - Skill 1311
                    - Skill 13111
    - Skill 2
        - Skill 21
        - Skill 22


## Estimated Max Time
10min

## Scope

- Keep coding in JS.
- Since it's purely algorithmic, it's primilarly not necessary to rely on another packages than those provided by JS core but it can be argued.
